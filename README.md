IBM Quantum Learing Course - Variational Algorithm design 
This repo is just a place to house the python files I have created as I follow along with 
the IBM course. The examples are not my own, all credit goes to IBM's Quantum Learning. 
More information on this can be found here https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/
